# Development Learnings

This document captures key learnings and insights from developing Picito.

## Technical Learnings

### 1. Responsive Project Content Handling
- CSS transform-based scaling is more performant than JavaScript-based size calculations
- Hardware acceleration through `transform-style: preserve-3d` prevents flickering
- Mobile browsers require special handling for overflow and touch events

### 2. React + Next.js Architecture
- Server Components in Next.js 15.3.4 improve initial load performance
- Styled-components work well with Next.js Server Components when properly configured
- TypeScript strict mode catches many potential runtime errors early

### 3. MongoDB Integration
- MongoDB Atlas provides reliable cloud database solution
- Mongoose schemas help maintain data consistency
- Connection pooling important for production performance
- Schema versioning and migrations need careful planning
- User data requires additional security considerations

## UI/UX Insights

### 1. Viewport Management
- Full viewport coverage requires careful CSS reset
- Mobile browsers have unique viewport calculation requirements
- Touch events need special consideration for mobile UX

### 2. Performance Optimization
- Debouncing resize events crucial for smooth performance
- RequestAnimationFrame helps with smooth animations
- Browser DevTools essential for testing various viewport sizes

### 3. Cross-browser Compatibility
- Safari requires additional CSS properties for proper rendering
- Mobile browsers need special touch event handling
- Transform properties need vendor prefixes for maximum compatibility

## Development Process

### 1. Testing Strategy
- Manual testing across different devices essential
- Browser DevTools device emulation helpful but not sufficient
- Real device testing crucial for mobile experience

### 2. Code Organization
- Component-based architecture promotes reusability
- TypeScript interfaces ensure type safety
- Styled-components keep styles scoped and maintainable

### 3. Deployment
- Vercel deployment process is straightforward
- Environment variables need careful management
- Build optimization important for production performance

## Future Considerations

### 1. Performance Enhancements
- Consider implementing virtual DOM diffing optimization
- Explore ways to reduce bundle size
- Investigate service worker implementation for offline support

### 2. Feature Ideas
- Consider adding animation options
- Explore additional content scaling algorithms
- Add support for multiple concurrent projects

### 3. Technical Debt
- Monitor styled-components performance impact
- Consider alternatives to MongoDB for simpler deployments
- Review and optimize error handling
- Improve user authentication flow
- Enhance legal acceptance tracking

## Navigation and User Experience

### 1. Real-time Navigation Updates
- `usePathname` and `useRouter` hooks provide effective real-time navigation state management
- Session checking on path changes ensures authentication state consistency
- Dynamic menu visibility based on user role improves user experience
- Automatic session refresh prevents stale authentication states

### 2. Terminology Consistency
- Consistent terminology across UI components improves user comprehension
- "Projects" terminology better reflects the application's purpose than "iFrame"
- Admin navigation benefits from clear, descriptive labels

### 3. Component Architecture for Navigation
- Header component with real-time updates provides seamless user experience
- Conditional rendering based on authentication state reduces UI clutter
- Styled-components enable consistent navigation styling across components

## Development Best Practices

### 1. Implementation Safety
- Follow incremental development approach to minimize risk
- Always test existing functionality before adding new features
- Use established patterns from existing codebase for consistency
- Reference [DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md](./docs/DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md) for detailed implementation guidelines

### 2. Error Prevention
- Database connection issues prevented through proper connection reuse
- API route conflicts avoided by following Next.js App Router conventions
- Authentication problems mitigated by copying existing middleware patterns
- Model schema conflicts prevented through proper TypeScript interfaces

### 3. Safe Development Workflow
- Create backup branches before major feature implementation
- Test API endpoints manually before UI integration
- Verify no breaking changes to existing functionality
- Follow established commit patterns and documentation updates

## Database and Configuration Management

### 1. Environment Variable Management
- **Mistake**: Hardcoded MongoDB connection string in `db.ts` instead of using environment variables
- **Impact**: Database connection failures when local/remote configurations differ
- **Solution**: Always use `process.env.MONGODB_URI` with proper fallback and validation
- **Learning**: Environment variables should be the single source of truth for all configuration

### 2. Mongoose Schema Index Management
- **Mistake**: Duplicate index definitions (`unique: true` in field + `schema.index()`)
- **Impact**: Mongoose warnings during build and potential performance issues
- **Solution**: Use explicit `schema.index()` calls instead of field-level `unique: true`
- **Learning**: Choose one indexing approach and stick to it consistently

### 3. Database Connection Debugging
- **Observation**: MongoDB Atlas connection issues can manifest as authentication failures
- **Debugging**: Check network connectivity, connection string format, and firewall settings
- **Best Practice**: Always test database connectivity in isolation before debugging application logic

## API Development Challenges

### 1. Next.js App Router Route Parameters
- **Mistake**: Incorrect TypeScript typing for dynamic route parameters in API handlers
- **Error**: `Type { params: { id: string } } is not assignable to parameter type`
- **Solution**: Use `Promise<{ id: string }>` pattern for route parameters in Next.js 15+
- **Learning**: Next.js App Router requires Promise-based parameter handling

### 2. Mongoose TypeScript Integration
- **Challenge**: Lean queries return complex types that don't match interface definitions
- **Solution**: Use explicit type casting `as any` or proper interface typing for lean results
- **Learning**: Balance between type safety and practical development needs

### 3. Role-Based Access Control Implementation
- **Complexity**: Implementing hierarchical permissions (owner > admin > member)
- **Solution**: Create helper functions for permission checking and role management
- **Best Practice**: Define clear role hierarchies and document permission matrices

## Development Workflow Improvements

### 1. Incremental Feature Development
- **Success**: Epic 2.2 completed through small, testable increments
- **Approach**: Model → API → Integration → Testing
- **Benefit**: Early error detection and easier debugging

### 2. Documentation-Driven Development
- **Practice**: Create comprehensive implementation guides before coding
- **Result**: Fewer mistakes, clearer requirements, better planning
- **Tool**: DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md serves as error prevention reference

### 3. Build-First Validation
- **Rule**: Always run `npm run build` after significant changes
- **Benefit**: Catches TypeScript errors early in development cycle
- **Practice**: Commit only after successful builds

## Mistake Categories and Prevention

### 1. Configuration Mistakes
- **Environment variables not properly managed**
- **Prevention**: Use `.env.example` file and validation
- **Tool**: Environment variable validation in startup code

### 2. Schema Design Mistakes
- **Duplicate indexes, missing validation, circular dependencies**
- **Prevention**: Review existing patterns before creating new models
- **Tool**: Schema validation and index analysis tools

### 3. API Design Mistakes
- **Inconsistent error handling, missing authentication, poor parameter validation**
- **Prevention**: Copy proven patterns from existing API routes
- **Tool**: API testing checklist and validation middleware

### 4. TypeScript Integration Mistakes
- **Incorrect type definitions, missing interfaces, type assertion overuse**
- **Prevention**: Use strict TypeScript configuration and proper interfaces
- **Tool**: Regular TypeScript compiler checks and ESLint rules
