# Development Learnings

This document captures key learnings and insights from developing Picito.

## Technical Learnings

### 1. Responsive iFrame Handling
- CSS transform-based scaling is more performant than JavaScript-based size calculations
- Hardware acceleration through `transform-style: preserve-3d` prevents flickering
- Mobile browsers require special handling for overflow and touch events

### 2. React + Next.js Architecture
- Server Components in Next.js 15.3.4 improve initial load performance
- Styled-components work well with Next.js Server Components when properly configured
- TypeScript strict mode catches many potential runtime errors early

### 3. MongoDB Integration
- MongoDB Atlas provides reliable cloud database solution
- Mongoose schemas help maintain data consistency
- Connection pooling important for production performance

## UI/UX Insights

### 1. Viewport Management
- Full viewport coverage requires careful CSS reset
- Mobile browsers have unique viewport calculation requirements
- Touch events need special consideration for mobile UX

### 2. Performance Optimization
- Debouncing resize events crucial for smooth performance
- RequestAnimationFrame helps with smooth animations
- Browser DevTools essential for testing various viewport sizes

### 3. Cross-browser Compatibility
- Safari requires additional CSS properties for proper rendering
- Mobile browsers need special touch event handling
- Transform properties need vendor prefixes for maximum compatibility

## Development Process

### 1. Testing Strategy
- Manual testing across different devices essential
- Browser DevTools device emulation helpful but not sufficient
- Real device testing crucial for mobile experience

### 2. Code Organization
- Component-based architecture promotes reusability
- TypeScript interfaces ensure type safety
- Styled-components keep styles scoped and maintainable

### 3. Deployment
- Vercel deployment process is straightforward
- Environment variables need careful management
- Build optimization important for production performance

## Future Considerations

### 1. Performance Enhancements
- Consider implementing virtual DOM diffing optimization
- Explore ways to reduce bundle size
- Investigate service worker implementation for offline support

### 2. Feature Ideas
- Consider adding animation options
- Explore additional content scaling algorithms
- Add support for multiple concurrent iframes

### 3. Technical Debt
- Monitor styled-components performance impact
- Consider alternatives to MongoDB for simpler deployments
- Review and optimize error handling
