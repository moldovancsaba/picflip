# Testing Strategy

## ðŸš« E2E Testing Prohibition

E2E (End-to-End) testing is explicitly prohibited in this project for several reasons:

1. **Complexity**: E2E tests are difficult to maintain, slow to run, and prone to flakiness.
2. **Resource Intensity**: They require significant computational resources and time.
3. **Cost**: Setting up and maintaining E2E testing infrastructure is expensive.
4. **Reliability**: E2E tests often produce false negatives due to timing issues, network conditions, etc.

### âœ… Preferred Testing Approaches

Instead of E2E tests, we use:

1. **Unit Tests**: Testing individual components, functions, and modules in isolation
2. **Integration Tests**: Testing interactions between closely related components
3. **Component Tests**: Testing React components with React Testing Library
4. **API Tests**: Testing API endpoints with Jest and supertest

### ðŸ”’ Enforcement

- No E2E testing frameworks (Cypress, Playwright, Selenium, etc.) should be added as dependencies
- No E2E test files should be created
- CI/CD pipelines will fail if E2E tests are detected
- Code reviews must reject any E2E test additions

## Testing Implementation

## Overview
As of 2025-06-27T14:28:43Z, this project has moved away from end-to-end (e2e) testing in favor of comprehensive unit testing. This decision was made to streamline our testing process and focus on more maintainable and faster-running tests.

## Current Testing Approach
- **Unit Tests**: We use Jest for unit testing our components, functions, and API routes
- **Coverage**: We maintain high test coverage through unit tests
- **No E2E Tests**: We have explicitly removed e2e testing (previously using Playwright) from our testing strategy

## Running Tests
To run the test suite:
```bash
npm run test        # Run all unit tests
npm run test:watch  # Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:coverage # Run tests with coverage report
```

## Writing New Tests
When adding new features or making changes:
1. Write comprehensive unit tests
2. Ensure test coverage remains at 100% for new changes
3. Focus on testing business logic and component behavior
4. Use Jest and React Testing Library for all tests

## What Was Removed
The following e2e testing related items have been removed:
- Playwright configuration
- E2E test directory and all e2e test files
- E2E related npm scripts
- Playwright and related dependencies

## Rationale
The decision to remove e2e tests was made to:
- Reduce maintenance overhead
- Speed up the test suite execution
- Focus testing efforts on unit tests
- Simplify the testing infrastructure

## Test Coverage Requirements
- All new changes must maintain 100% test coverage
- Coverage is tracked through Jest's coverage reporting
- Run `npm run test:coverage` to verify coverage metrics
