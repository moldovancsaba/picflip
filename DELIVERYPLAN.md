## Epic 3.2 - Public/Private Projects Implementation Plan

**Start Date:** 2025-06-24T11:33:04.000Z  
**Target Completion:** 2025-06-24T13:00:00.000Z  
**Priority:** Independent feature, no dependencies

### Implementation Approach

Following the established safe development patterns from Epic 2.2 success:

1. **Schema Update First** - Add isPublic field to Settings model
2. **API Implementation** - Create visibility control endpoints  
3. **Access Control Logic** - Implement public/private access rules
4. **Testing & Validation** - Ensure no breaking changes

### User Stories Implementation Plan

#### Story 3.2.1: Project Visibility Schema Update (30 minutes)
- **Goal**: Add visibility settings to existing projects
- **Changes**: 
  - Add `isPublic` boolean field to Settings model
  - Default to false (private) for security
  - Maintain backward compatibility
- **Testing**: Verify existing projects remain private by default

#### Story 3.2.2: Project Visibility API (45 minutes)
- **Goal**: Create API endpoint to control project visibility
- **Changes**:
  - Create PATCH /api/settings/[id]/visibility endpoint
  - Role-based access control (only project creators)
  - Proper validation and error handling
- **Testing**: Manual API testing with different user roles

#### Story 3.2.3: Public Project Access Control (45 minutes)
- **Goal**: Allow anonymous access to public projects
- **Changes**:
  - Update iframe routes to check visibility
  - Public projects accessible without login
  - Private projects require authentication
  - SEO-friendly public project URLs
- **Testing**: Test both public and private project access

### Risk Mitigation

- **No Breaking Changes**: Existing projects remain private by default
- **Security First**: Default to private, explicit public setting required
- **Backward Compatibility**: All existing functionality preserved
- **Incremental Testing**: Test each component before proceeding

### Success Criteria

- [x] isPublic field added to Settings model ✅
- [x] Visibility API endpoint working with proper access control ✅
- [x] Public projects accessible without authentication ✅
- [x] Private projects require authentication ✅
- [x] All existing functionality preserved ✅
